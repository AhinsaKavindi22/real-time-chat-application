## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v14 or newer)
-   MongoDB (local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
-   A Cloudinary account (for image uploads)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AhinsaKavindi22/real-time-chat-application.git
    cd real-time-chat-application
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    -   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    -   Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    -   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables with your own credentials:
        ```env
        PORT=5000
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

        # Cloudinary Credentials
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
        ```
    -   Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        npm run server
        ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    -   Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd client
        ```
    -   Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    -   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the backend URL:
        ```env
        VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
        ```
    -   Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Available Scripts
